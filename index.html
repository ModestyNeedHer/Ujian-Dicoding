            Genshin Impact is a 2020 action role-playing video game produced by
            MiHoYo/HoYoverse. The game features an anime-style open world
            environment and an action-based battle system using elemental magic
            and character-switching. A free-to-play game monetized through gacha
            game mechanics, Genshin Impact is updated regularly using the games
            as a service model; it was originally released for Android, iOS,
            PlayStation 4, and Windows, followed by PlayStation 5 in 2021, with
            an Xbox Series X/S version coming in November 2024.

            <h3>Emilie</h3>
            <p>
              She is a renowned perfume designer in Fontaine. According to
              Calcagni, Emilie is self-employed, and the fashionable ladies of
              Fontaine highly seek out her products. She also works closely with
              detective forces and law enforcement as a "forensic cleanser" in
              the background, which allows her to give additional information
              that most people might miss at the cost of forcing her to become
              more familiar with death than she would like.

              She is the optimistic president of the Spina di Rosula, a mantle
              previously held by her late father Callas. Her enthusiastic and
              tenacious spirit allow her to push on with helping the people of
              Fontaine in spite of the various losses in her life.

              A magnificent polearm adorned with azure crystal. It is said to

              yet, not once was it ever used.

            <p>
              Pearls, gems, and gold — such are the bounty of the mountains.
              Their ancient, honored titles are the blessings of the past. It is
              within the furnaces of the Children of Echoes that all these
              blessings are brought to fruitio. Yet when the hammer's inexorable
              blows are halted by hesitation, the echoes that ring out through
              the peaks also fall mute... Can the Name Engraver, who has the
              watchful eye of the mountains, hear that which the ridges tell of?
